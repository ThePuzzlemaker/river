//! Capability table interface for use in all syscalls in river.
//!
//! # A Rough Overview
//!
//! River is a capability-based operating system. Thus, all syscalls
//! require certain "capabilities" to perform, and the set of which
//! capabilities your thread has access to determines what actions it
//! can perform.
//!
//! To put it briefly, a capability is an unforgeable token. This
//! means that it refers to some resource in the kernel (e.g., a page
//! table, a thread, an IPC endpoint, a device, etc.) that a given
//! thread can perform certain actions on. Unforgeable here means
//! simply that there is no way for a thread to "fake" having a
//! capability--i.e., if they have the capability, they are guaranteed
//! to have "proper" access to the resource.
//!
//! Interestingly enough, a *nix file descriptor is a somewhat good
//! example of the (rough) idea of a capability: it is an opaque,
//! unforgeable value given to the userspace thread by the kernel (via
//! `open`) that provides access to a resource (`read`, `write`,
//! etc.).
//!
//! Capablities in river are represented to the userspace thread as a
//! [`Captr`] ("capability pointer", pronounced like "captor"; but to
//! be frank, pronounce it however you like). This is similar to a
//! *nix file descriptor in that it is simply a number (represented by
//! a `usize`) that is an index in a thread's capability
//! table. Userspace threads cannot "dereference" a [`Captr`], but
//! they can enumerate details about what it points to (i.e., what
//! type of capability, and any relevant metadata as necessary).
